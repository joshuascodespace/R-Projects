# R-Projects
This repository contains various statistical analyses using R. These analyses were assigned for me to complete in a statistical computing class.

arsenic.RDS, RHR.RDS, divorce.txt, trees.txt, and wine.txt are all data files used in code.
Regression-Coefficient-Testing.Rmd, Regression-Model-Testing.Rmd, and Regression-Model-Selection all contain R code that represents my R-coding abilities.
